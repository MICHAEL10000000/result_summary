## My process

The idea behind building this project is creating an inner box which is colored and with the candidate result and an outer box which is not colored. Both boxes are flexed. The body of the document is flexed and set to a min-height of 100vh and that is why the page is static as it is

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

In coming days i look forward to building with flex grow and flex shrinks in other to save me the stress of having to resize things in mobile state
